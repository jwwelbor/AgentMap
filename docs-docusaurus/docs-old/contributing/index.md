# Contributing to AgentMap

Welcome to the AgentMap community! üéâ We're excited that you want to contribute to the future of agentic AI workflows and multi-agent systems. This guide will help you get started with contributing to AgentMap, from your first bug report to major feature development.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+** - AgentMap is built for modern Python
- **Poetry** - Our preferred package manager
- **Git** - For version control and collaboration

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jwwelbor/AgentMap.git
cd AgentMap

# 2. Install dependencies with development tools
poetry install --with dev

# 3. Set up pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
poetry run pre-commit install

# 4. Run tests to verify setup
poetry run pytest

# 5. Format code to match project standards
poetry run black src/ tests/
poetry run isort src/ tests/

# 6. Start developing!
```

## üìã Project Overview

AgentMap is a declarative orchestration framework that transforms CSV files into powerful AI agent workflows. Our mission is to make agentic AI accessible while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and performance.

### Core Principles
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with domain boundaries
- **Dependency Injection**: Service management through DI containers
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Modular services with well-defined interfaces
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing at all levels
- **Developer Experience**: Tools and patterns that make development enjoyable

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Understanding AgentMap's architecture will help you contribute effectively:

```
src/agentmap/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/           # Agent implementations and types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/            # Core framework components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ di/              # Dependency injection containers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exceptions/      # Custom exception classes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/          # Data models and schemas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # Business logic services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/       # Code generation templates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts.py       # Prompt management system
```

### Key Components
- **Agents**: Individual AI components that perform specific tasks
- **Services**: Business logic that orchestrates agents and manages state
- **Models**: Data structures using Pydantic for validation
- **DI Container**: Manages service dependencies and lifecycle

## üêç Code Standards

### Code Style
We use automated tooling to maintain consistent code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting with 88-character line length
- **isort**: Import sorting compatible with Black
- **flake8**: Code quality and complexity enforcement
- **Type Hints**: Required for all public APIs

### Naming Conventions
```python
# Classes - PascalCase
class GraphBuilderService:
    pass

# Functions and methods - snake_case
def build_agent_graph(self):
    pass

# Constants - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30

# Private methods - leading underscore
def _internal_helper(self):
    pass

# Files - snake_case
# graph_builder_service.py
```

### Import Organization
Follow this import order in all Python files:

```python
# 1. Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

# 2. Third-party imports
import pandas as pd
from pydantic import BaseModel

# 3. Local imports
from agentmap.models.graph import Graph
from agentmap.services.base import BaseService
```

## üß™ Testing Standards

Quality testing is crucial for AgentMap's reliability. We use a three-tier testing approach:

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`) - Fast, isolated tests with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`) - Service coordination tests
- **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/e2e/`) - Complete workflow tests

### Coverage Requirements
- **Overall Minimum**: 80% code coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 95% coverage for core functionality
- **Public APIs**: 100% coverage for all public interfaces

### Test Naming and Organization
```python
# File: test_graph_builder_service.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

class TestGraphBuilderService:
    """Test suite for GraphBuilderService"""
    
    def test_build_graph_success(self, mock_di_container):
        """Test successful graph building with valid input"""
        # Arrange
        service = GraphBuilderService(mock_di_container)
        
        # Act
        result = service.build_graph("test_graph")
        
        # Assert
        assert result is not None
        assert result.name == "test_graph"
    
    def test_build_graph_invalid_input_raises_exception(self):
        """Test that invalid input raises appropriate exception"""
        # Test implementation here
        pass
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage report
poetry run pytest --cov=src/agentmap --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
poetry run pytest tests/unit/
poetry run pytest tests/integration/
poetry run pytest tests/e2e/

# Run tests matching a pattern
poetry run pytest -k "test_graph_builder"
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
We follow a structured branching model:

- **main** - Production-ready code, always deployable
- **develop** - Integration branch for ongoing development
- **feature/\*** - New features (`feature/add-anthropic-agent`)
- **bugfix/\*** - Bug fixes (`bugfix/fix-memory-leak`)
- **hotfix/\*** - Critical production fixes

### Commit Standards
Use conventional commits for clear project history:

**Format**: `type(scope): description`

**Types**:
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes  
- `docs` - Documentation updates
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring without feature changes
- `test` - Test additions or modifications
- `chore` - Build process or tool changes

**Examples**:
```bash
feat(agents): add new anthropic agent implementation
fix(core): resolve circular import in graph builder
docs(api): update CSV schema documentation
test(services): add integration tests for storage services
refactor(di): simplify service registration pattern
```

### Pull Request Process
