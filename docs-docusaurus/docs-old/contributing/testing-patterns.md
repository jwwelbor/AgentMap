# Testing Documentation Moved

The testing documentation has been reorganized for better usability and AI-assisted conversations.

:::info New Testing Documentation Structure
The testing content previously in this file has been moved to a dedicated testing section with improved organization:

**🆕 New Location: [/docs/testing/](/docs/testing/)**
:::

## Quick Navigation

### 🔧 [Quick Reference](/docs/testing/quick-reference)
Essential patterns, Python 3.11 compatibility, and immediate problem solving.

### 📖 [Comprehensive Guide](/docs/testing/comprehensive-guide) 
Detailed examples, service integration, and advanced scenarios.

### 🔍 [Troubleshooting](/docs/testing/troubleshooting)
Debugging reference with diagnostic scripts and step-by-step solutions.

### 🚀 [Advanced Patterns](/docs/testing/advanced-patterns)
Performance testing, security patterns, and specialized scenarios.

- ✅ **Better organization** - Content grouped by purpose and complexity
- ✅ **AI-conversation optimized** - Easy to reference specific sections during troubleshooting
- ✅ **Reduced duplication** - No more maintaining content in multiple places
- ✅ **Clearer learning path** - From quick fixes to advanced patterns
