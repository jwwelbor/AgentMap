## Step 2: Understanding Human-AI Collaboration

### The HumanAgent

The `HumanAgent` is a special agent type that pauses workflow execution to request human input:

```csv
RequestHumanReview,Get human feedback on analysis and summary,human,ProcessFeedback,ErrorHandler,"analysis_result,executive_summary",human_feedback,"[prompt for human]","{""timeout"": 300, ""required_fields"": [""accuracy_assessment"", ""approval_decision""]}"
```

**Key Configuration Options**:
- `timeout`: Maximum wait time for human response (seconds)
- `required_fields`: Fields that must be provided by human
- `optional_fields`: Additional fields human can provide
- `validation_rules`: Rules for validating human input

### The SummaryAgent

Our custom `SummaryAgent` provides intelligent summarization:

**Configuration Options**:
```json
{
  "summary_type": "executive|technical|bullet_points|standard",
  "focus_areas": ["key_findings", "recommendations", "risks"],
  "max_length": 500,
  "include_metrics": true
}
```

**Summary Types**:
- **Executive**: Strategic insights for leadership
- **Technical**: Implementation details for developers
- **Bullet Points**: Quick scan format
- **Standard**: Balanced overview

## Step 3: Interactive Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Approval Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[AI Analysis] --> B[Generate Summary]
    B --> C[Human Review]
    C --> D{Approval?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Final Report]
    D -->|Revise| F[Enhanced Analysis]
    D -->|Reject| G[Alternative Approach]
    F --> B
    G --> B
```

### Pattern 2: Iterative Refinement

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Initial Analysis] --> B[Human Feedback]
    B --> C[Incorporate Feedback]
    C --> D[Refined Analysis]
    D --> E{Quality Check}
    E -->|Good| F[Complete]
    E -->|Improve| B
```

### Pattern 3: Quality Assurance

Human reviewers act as quality gates:
- **Accuracy Validation**: Verify AI analysis accuracy
- **Completeness Check**: Ensure nothing important is missed
- **Context Addition**: Provide domain expertise
- **Priority Adjustment**: Rerank importance based on business needs

## Step 4: Running the Interactive System

### Setup and Execution

1. **Create Working Directory**:
```bash
mkdir -p human-ai-collaboration/data
cd human-ai-collaboration
```

2. **Download All Files**:
   - lesson5.csv (interactive workflow)
   - review_content.txt (sample business review)
   - summary_agent.py (custom summary agent)

3. **Set Environment**:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

4. **Run Interactive Workflow**:
```bash
agentmap run lesson5.csv
```

### What to Expect

The workflow will:
1. **Analyze** the business review content with AI
2. **Generate** an executive summary
3. **Pause** and ask for your feedback
4. **Wait** for your input on accuracy and approval decision
5. **Adapt** based on your feedback
6. **Generate** final report incorporating your insights

### Sample Human Interaction

When the workflow pauses, you'll see:

```
Please review the AI analysis and summary below:

## 🤖 AI Analysis Results
[Comprehensive analysis of the business review]

## 📋 Executive Summary
[Generated executive summary]

**Please provide your feedback:**

1. **Accuracy Assessment** (1-10): How accurate is the AI analysis?
2. **Completeness Review**: What important points did the AI miss?
3. **Priority Ranking**: Which findings are most/least important?
4. **Action Items**: What specific actions should be taken?
5. **Additional Context**: What context should be added?
6. **Approval Decision**: APPROVE/REVISE/REJECT

Enter your response:
```

### Sample Human Response

```
Accuracy Assessment: 8
The AI correctly identified most key metrics and trends.

Completeness Review: 
- Missing analysis of competitive threats from the new $50M funded startup
- Should emphasize the critical nature of the hiring plan
- Infrastructure costs scaling faster than revenue is a bigger concern

Priority Ranking:
- HIGHEST: Operational scaling challenges (affects customer satisfaction)
- HIGH: Infrastructure limitations (affects all users) 
- MEDIUM: Competitive pressure (manageable with differentiation)

Action Items:
1. Emergency hiring committee to accelerate the 12-person hiring plan
2. Immediate infrastructure assessment and upgrade timeline
3. Customer communication plan about improvements underway

Additional Context:
This is our first quarter showing operational strain. Previous quarters managed growth smoothly. The 18-hour support response time is already affecting customer satisfaction scores.

Approval Decision: REVISE
Need to emphasize operational urgency and adjust priority ranking
```

## Step 5: Advanced Human-AI Patterns

### Dynamic Routing Based on Human Input

```python
def route_based_on_human_feedback(feedback):
    decision = feedback.get('approval_decision', 'REVISE')
    
    if decision == 'APPROVE':
        return 'GenerateFinalReport'
    elif decision == 'REVISE':
        return 'EnhancedAnalysis'
    elif decision == 'REJECT':
        return 'AlternativeAnalysis'
    else:
        return 'RequestClarification'
```

### Confidence-Adjusted Processing

```python
def adjust_processing_based_on_confidence(ai_confidence, human_confidence):
    """Adjust workflow based on confidence levels."""
    
    if ai_confidence > 0.9 and human_confidence > 8:
        return 'fast_track'  # Both AI and human are confident
    elif ai_confidence < 0.6 or human_confidence < 5:
        return 'detailed_review'  # Low confidence, need thorough review
    else:
        return 'standard_review'  # Normal processing
```

### Learning from Human Feedback

```python
class LearningWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feedback_history = []
    
    def process_human_feedback(self, feedback):
        # Store feedback for learning
        self.feedback_history.append({
            'timestamp': datetime.now(),
            'feedback': feedback,
            'ai_confidence': self.last_ai_confidence,
            'outcome': 'success' if feedback.get('approval_decision') == 'APPROVE' else 'revision'
        })
        
        # Adjust future processing based on patterns
        self.update_processing_parameters()
    
    def update_processing_parameters(self):
        """Update AI processing based on human feedback patterns."""
        recent_feedback = self.feedback_history[-10:]  # Last 10 interactions
        
        # Analyze patterns
        common_missing_areas = self.analyze_missed_areas(recent_feedback)
        common_priority_adjustments = self.analyze_priority_patterns(recent_feedback)
        
        # Update processing focus
        self.adjust_analysis_focus(common_missing_areas)
        self.adjust_priority_weights(common_priority_adjustments)
```

## Step 6: Building Custom Interactive Agents

### Exercise 1: Create Validation Agent

Build an agent that validates AI output before human review:

```python
class ValidationAgent(BaseAgent):
    def process(self, inputs):
        ai_analysis = inputs.get('analysis_result', {})
        
        validation_results = {
            'completeness_score': self._check_completeness(ai_analysis),
            'consistency_score': self._check_consistency(ai_analysis),
            'confidence_assessment': self._assess_confidence(ai_analysis),
            'flagged_areas': self._identify_concerns(ai_analysis),
            'validation_passed': False
        }
        
        # Overall validation decision
        if (validation_results['completeness_score'] > 0.7 and 
            validation_results['consistency_score'] > 0.8 and
            len(validation_results['flagged_areas']) < 3):
            validation_results['validation_passed'] = True
        
        return validation_results
```

### Exercise 2: Implement Feedback Learning

Create a system that learns from human feedback:

```python
class FeedbackLearningAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.feedback_db = {}  # In practice, use proper database
        
    def process(self, inputs):
        human_feedback = inputs.get('human_feedback', {})
        ai_analysis = inputs.get('analysis_result', {})
        
        # Analyze feedback patterns
        feedback_insights = {
            'accuracy_trend': self._calculate_accuracy_trend(),
            'common_gaps': self._identify_common_gaps(),
            'priority_misalignments': self._find_priority_issues(),
            'improvement_suggestions': self._generate_improvements()
        }
        
        # Store for future learning
        self._store_feedback_data(human_feedback, ai_analysis)
        
        return feedback_insights
    
    def _calculate_accuracy_trend(self):
        """Calculate accuracy improvement over time."""
        recent_scores = [feedback.get('accuracy_assessment', 5) 
                        for feedback in self.feedback_db.values()]
        
        if len(recent_scores) >= 2:
            return {
                'current_average': sum(recent_scores) / len(recent_scores),
                'trend': 'improving' if recent_scores[-1] > recent_scores[-2] else 'declining'
            }
        return {'current_average': 5, 'trend': 'insufficient_data'}
```

### Exercise 3: Multi-Human Consensus

Build a workflow that gets input from multiple humans:

```csv
workflow,node,description,type,next_node,error_node,input_fields,output_field,prompt,context
MultiReview,GetReviewer1,Get feedback from first reviewer,human,GetReviewer2,Error,analysis,reviewer1_feedback,"Review as Domain Expert...","{""timeout"": 300}"
MultiReview,GetReviewer2,Get feedback from second reviewer,human,GetReviewer3,Error,analysis,reviewer2_feedback,"Review as Business Stakeholder...","{""timeout"": 300}"
MultiReview,GetReviewer3,Get feedback from third reviewer,human,BuildConsensus,Error,analysis,reviewer3_feedback,"Review as Technical Lead...","{""timeout"": 300}"
MultiReview,BuildConsensus,Build consensus from multiple reviews,consensus_builder,FinalDecision,Error,"reviewer1_feedback,reviewer2_feedback,reviewer3_feedback",consensus_result,,
```

## Step 7: Best Practices for Human-AI Collaboration

### Design Principles

#### 1. **Clear Human Instructions**
- Provide specific questions rather than open-ended requests
- Use structured input formats for consistency
- Include examples of good feedback

#### 2. **Appropriate Timeout Settings**
- Complex reviews: 10-30 minutes (600-1800 seconds)
- Simple approvals: 2-5 minutes (120-300 seconds)
- Emergency decisions: 30-60 seconds

#### 3. **Graceful Fallbacks**
- Default actions when humans don't respond
- Alternative workflows for different response types
- Clear error messages and recovery options

#### 4. **Context Preservation**
- Maintain conversation history
- Show relevant previous decisions
- Preserve human preferences across sessions

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

#### Pitfall 1: Information Overload
**Problem**: Presenting too much information to human reviewers
**Solution**: Use progressive disclosure and focused summaries

#### Pitfall 2: Unclear Decision Points
**Problem**: Humans unsure what decision is needed
**Solution**: Provide clear decision frameworks and examples

#### Pitfall 3: Lost Context
**Problem**: Humans lose track of workflow state
**Solution**: Include workflow progress indicators and relevant history

#### Pitfall 4: Inconsistent Feedback
**Problem**: Different humans provide conflicting guidance
**Solution**: Implement consensus mechanisms and feedback validation

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. **Async Human Input**
```python
async def handle_human_input_async(workflow_id, prompt, timeout=300):
    """Handle human input asynchronously."""
    
    # Store prompt and create notification
    await store_human_request(workflow_id, prompt)
    await notify_human_reviewer(workflow_id)
    
    # Wait for response with timeout
    response = await wait_for_human_response(workflow_id, timeout)
    
    if response:
        return response
    else:
        return await handle_timeout(workflow_id)
```

#### 2. **Intelligent Batching**
```python
def batch_human_requests(pending_requests):
    """Batch multiple requests for efficiency."""
    
    # Group by reviewer type
    batched = {}
    for request in pending_requests:
        reviewer_type = request.get('reviewer_type', 'general')
        if reviewer_type not in batched:
            batched[reviewer_type] = []
        batched[reviewer_type].append(request)
    
    return batched
```

#### 3. **Smart Routing**
```python
def route_to_appropriate_human(task_complexity, domain, urgency):
    """Route tasks to humans based on expertise and availability."""
    
    if urgency == 'HIGH':
        return get_available_expert(domain)
    elif task_complexity > 0.8:
        return get_senior_reviewer(domain)
    else:
        return get_available_reviewer()
```
