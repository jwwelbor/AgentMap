# Testing Documentation Moved

The comprehensive testing documentation has been reorganized into a dedicated testing section for better usability and AI-assisted conversations.

:::info New Testing Documentation Structure
The detailed testing content previously in this file has been moved to a dedicated testing section:

**🆕 New Location: [/docs/testing/](/docs/testing/)**
:::

## Quick Navigation to New Structure

### 🔧 [Quick Reference](/docs/testing/quick-reference)
- Essential patterns and immediate problem solving
- Python 3.11 compatibility (critical for CI failures)
- MockServiceFactory usage
- Path mocking quick fixes
- Anti-patterns to avoid

### 📖 [Comprehensive Guide](/docs/testing/comprehensive-guide)
- **Service integration testing** with multiple dependencies
- **End-to-end workflow testing** from CSV to execution  
- **Performance testing** patterns and benchmarks
- **Advanced mock coordination** scenarios
- **Test data management** strategies

### 🔍 [Troubleshooting](/docs/testing/troubleshooting)
- **CI failure debugging** with diagnostic scripts
- **Mock call debugging** step-by-step solutions
- **Path mocking issues** resolution
- **Performance test failures** analysis
- **Security test problems** fixes

### 🚀 [Advanced Patterns](/docs/testing/advanced-patterns)
- **Performance and load testing** comprehensive patterns
- **Security testing** authentication and validation
- **Integration testing** multi-service coordination
- **Monitoring and observability** testing
- **CI/CD pipeline** testing strategies

## Advantages of New Structure

The reorganized testing documentation provides:

- ✅ **Purpose-driven organization** - Content grouped by immediate need vs comprehensive learning
- ✅ **AI-conversation friendly** - Easy to reference specific sections during troubleshooting
- ✅ **No content duplication** - Single source of truth for each pattern
- ✅ **Better learning progression** - From quick fixes to advanced scenarios
- ✅ **Granular troubleshooting** - Dedicated debugging reference

## For Development Conversations

When asking for testing help, the new structure makes it easier to:

1. **Reference specific sections** for targeted assistance
2. **Share diagnostic scripts** from the troubleshooting guide
3. **Point to relevant patterns** for your specific scenario
4. **Get quick fixes** vs comprehensive explanations as needed

## Migration Guide
