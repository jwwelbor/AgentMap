- **Benefits**: Single responsibility principle, clean separation of data tracking vs business logic

**Updated Implementation Plan**:
1. **ExecutionTrackingService**: Factory for pure ExecutionTracker instances (NO policy dependency)
2. **Clean ExecutionTracker**: Remove `update_graph_success()` and `graph_success` field - pure data tracking only
3. **GraphRunnerService Orchestration**: 
   - `execution_tracker.complete_execution()` (pure tracking)
   - `summary = execution_tracker.get_summary()` (raw data)
   - `graph_success = execution_policy_service.evaluate_success_policy(summary)` (business logic)
   - Store policy result in ExecutionResult model

#### ⏳ DI Container Integration (PENDING)
**Dependencies**: ExecutionTrackingService completion
**Updated Approach**: All three services are independent (no dependency chain)

#### ⏳ GraphRunnerService Integration (PENDING)  
**Dependencies**: DI container updates
**Clean Architecture**: Service orchestrates policy evaluation instead of tracker doing it internally

#### ⏳ Comprehensive Testing (PENDING)
**Dependencies**: All services completed
**Scope**: Unit and integration tests for all three new services
