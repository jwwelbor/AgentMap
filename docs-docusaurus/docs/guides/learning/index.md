# AgentMap Learning Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive AgentMap Learning Guide! This hands-on tutorial series takes you from basic workflow creation to advanced multi-agent orchestration through four progressive lessons.

## Learning Path Overview

Each lesson builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts while reinforcing what you've learned. You'll work with real code examples and downloadable CSV files throughout the journey.

### ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

- **Agent Fundamentals**: Creating workflows with built-in agents
- **Prompt Engineering**: Customizing AI behavior through effective prompting
- **Custom Agent Development**: Building your own specialized agents
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple agents intelligently

## Lesson Overview

### Lesson 1: Basic Agents
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes | **Difficulty**: Beginner

Learn the fundamentals by creating a simple workflow that collects user input, processes it with AI, and saves the results to a CSV file.

**Key Concepts**:
- InputAgent for user interaction
- LLMAgent for AI processing
- CSVWriterAgent for data persistence
- Basic workflow structure

**What You'll Build**: A simple data collection and processing pipeline

---

### Lesson 2: Custom Prompts  
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes | **Difficulty**: Beginner-Intermediate

Enhance your workflow by customizing AI behavior through prompt engineering and context parameters.

**Key Concepts**:
- Prompt template design
- Context parameters for LLMAgent
- Temperature and model selection
- Prompt optimization techniques

**What You'll Build**: An enhanced version of Lesson 1 with intelligent prompt customization

---

### Lesson 3: Custom Agent Development
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes | **Difficulty**: Intermediate

Create your own specialized agent by extending BaseAgent and implementing custom business logic.

**Key Concepts**:
- BaseAgent inheritance patterns
- Custom process() method implementation
- CapableAgent protocols
- Agent scaffold generation
- Error handling and logging

**What You'll Build**: A custom validation agent with specialized processing logic

---

### Lesson 4: Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Duration**: 90-120 minutes | **Difficulty**: Intermediate-Advanced

Build a sophisticated workflow that intelligently routes requests between multiple specialized agents.

**Key Concepts**:
- OrchestratorAgent usage
- Keyword-based routing
- Multiple custom agents
- Advanced workflow patterns
- Agent coordination strategies

**What You'll Build**: An intelligent routing system with multiple specialized processing agents
