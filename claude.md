# Claude Code Sub Agent Configuration
## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### üî¥ MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:
1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
```

**Examples of WRONG sequential execution:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")
Message 6: Bash("npm install")
// This is 6x slower and breaks coordination!
```

### üéØ CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:

Before sending ANY message, ask yourself:
- ‚úÖ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL memory operations concurrent?

## ü§ñ Claude Sub-Agents Integration

This project includes 15 specialized AI sub-agents for enhanced development.

### Available Agents

The following agents are installed in `.claude/agents/`:

- **project-planner**: Strategic planning and task decomposition specialist
- **api-developer**: Backend API development specialist with PRP awareness
- **frontend-developer**: Modern web interface implementation specialist
- **tdd-specialist**: Test-driven development and comprehensive testing expert
- **code-reviewer**: Code quality, security, and best practices analyst
- **debugger**: Error analysis and debugging specialist
- **refactor**: Code refactoring and improvement specialist
- **doc-writer**: Technical documentation specialist
- **security-scanner**: Security vulnerability detection specialist
- **devops-engineer**: CI/CD and deployment automation specialist
- **product-manager**: Product requirements and user story specialist
- **marketing-writer**: Technical marketing content specialist
- **api-documenter**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation specialist
- **test-runner**: Automated test execution specialist
- **shadcn-ui-builder**: UI/UX implementation with ShadCN components

### Using Sub-Agents

Agents work alongside your existing PRPs and can be invoked in several ways:

1. **Direct execution**: `claude-agents run <agent> --task "description"`
2. **Task tool in Claude Code**: `Task("agent-name: task description")`
3. **Agent slash commands**: Located in `.claude/commands/agents/`

### Memory System

Agents share context and coordinate through:
- **Memory Store**: `.swarm/memory.json` for persistent agent memory
- **Context Sharing**: Agents can access shared project context
- **PRP Integration**: Agents are aware of and can work with your PRPs

### Best Practices

- Use agents for specialized tasks that match their expertise
- Agents can read and understand your PRPs for context
- Multiple agents can work on different aspects of the same feature
- Memory system allows agents to build on each other's work
If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!

    agent_test: Focus on business logic, mock external services
    protocol_mock: Mock protocols, not concrete classes

decisions:
  new_service_when:
    - Distinct business domain (user management, graph execution, etc.)
    - 3+ classes would use the functionality
    - Complex logic that deserves isolated testing
    - Cross-cutting concern (logging, configuration, etc.)
  extend_existing_when:
    - Adding method to existing domain
    - Simple helper functionality
    - Single use case
    - Related to existing service responsibility
  refactor_when:
    - Service exceeds 350 lines
    - Method exceeds 50 lines
    - Multiple responsibilities detected
    - Code duplication across services
  common_questions:
    "Where does X logic go?": Check domain - models=data, services=logic

    "How to test X?": Unit tests with MockServiceFactory, integration with DI
    "Where to configure Y?": AppConfigService for domain logic, ConfigService for YAML
