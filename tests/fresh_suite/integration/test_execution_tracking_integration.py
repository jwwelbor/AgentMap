"""
Execution Tracking Integration Tests.

This module contains targeted integration tests that verify execution tracking works
correctly end-to-end. These tests specifically address issues that were found where:

1. Graph names from CSV were not preserved in execution results
2. Execution tracking was creating individual trackers instead of shared ones
3. Node executions were not being recorded properly
4. Final output was not being captured in execution summary

These tests follow established patterns from BaseIntegrationTest and would have
caught the original bugs before they reached production.
