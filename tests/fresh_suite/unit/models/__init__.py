"""
Domain Model Data Container Tests for AgentMap Fresh Test Suite.

This package contains tests for domain models, validating that they function
as pure data containers following the established architecture principle that
models contain no business logic, only data storage and access functionality.

These tests focus exclusively on:
- Data initialization and storage
- Property access and modification  
- Simple data query methods
- Data container composition and relationships

Business logic testing belongs in service tests, not model tests.
